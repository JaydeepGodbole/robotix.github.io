###Introduction
A test of wits between nemeses is an age-old story, and as the story goes the two rivals never actually defeat one another, they just make it harder and harder for the other one to survive. In one such turn of events, Moriarty has captured Sherlock and left him stranded in a desert wasteland with nothing but a compass in his pocket. Sherlock has to make his way out of the desert in the shortest path given that he has no supplies at hand. The problem is simple, but the solution is complex, those who like a good challenge have a chance to prove their mettle.

###Problem Statement

Build an autonomous robot that can decode encoded wireless signals to navigate in a featureless arena using only a digital compass.
