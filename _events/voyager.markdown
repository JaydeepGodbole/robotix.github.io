###Introduction
With terrestrial natural resources depleting by the day, humanity is turning its face towards the much unexplored aquatic realm, with hope of harnessing the huge resource bank in the form of the oceans. That’d require efficient transfer mechanisms between land and sea and heavy duty transmission jobs which would require mechanized skills in the future. So here’s Voyager, a manual event involving terrestrial and floating robots for Robotix 2016 that asks for great degree of mechanical prowess, efficient mechanisms and hence paving way for more such complex machines for the future.

###Problem Statement

Build a pair of manually controlled robots that coordinate with each other to rebuild the broken pathway and fill the water puddles.

###USP

- Water Traversal
- Picking Objects

###Task 

- Build a pair of water traversing and terrestrial robot.
- Collect the covers for the puddles and fill the puddles.
- Pick up the broken parts of the pathway from water and complete it.

###Arena

###Arena Components

####Task zone Specification

- It will a 250 cm long and 50 cm wide rectangular region on the arena platform.
- It will have four puddles in each round, which need to be covered with the blocks placed on floating thermocol sheets on water.

####Bridge Specification

- There would be two bridges connecting the task zone and the start zone.
- Each bridge would be 75 cm long and 50cm wide, the bridges would be separated by a distance of 25 cm themselves.
- The bridges would be continuous in round 1 and would have two discontinuities each in round 2.

####Start zone Specification

- It would be 250 cm wide and 50 cm long.
- The start zone would be in between the task zone and the drop zone.
- The terrestrial robot has to start its traversal from this start zone at the beginning. 

####Drop Zone

- It would be 250cm wide and 25 cm long.
- This zone would be attached to an inclined plane of inclination 15 degree on one side and to the start zone on the other side.

#####Second Round

####Block Specification

- The puddles in the task zone need to be filled with these planks.
- These wooden planks would be of dimension 4 cm*4cm*4cm(l*b*h).
- The upper surface of the plank will be provided with a hook.
- The weight of the plank would be less than 200 g.

####Plank Specification

- The discontinuities in the bridges need to be covered with these planks.
- These are wooden planks of length 20 cm, width 15 cm and a height of 3cm.
- The upper surface of the plank would be provided with a hook.
- The weight of these planks would not be less than 300 g.
- These planks would be placed on the arena, instead of water.
- These planks would be colour coded and hence they need to be covered with their respective planks.
- The task of filling the puddles in the task zone, would be counted as done only after the robot has covered all the discontinuities in the bridge.

####Robot specification

- The water robot must fit in a box of 40cm x 40cm x 30cm and the terrestrial robot must fit in a box of 40cm x 30cm x 30cm, both with a tolerance of 10% in the dimensions of robot. No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event. However the dimensions can change during the course of the run.
- Dimensions of the arena are to be considered with a maximum tolerance of 10%.

###Rules

####General Rules

- A maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.
- The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply.
- Participants will have to themselves arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.
- Teams cannot tinker with their bots during the run.
- LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms))
- The decision of the Team Robotix will be final and binding.
- The rules are subject to change.

####Event Rules

- The robots need to use a suitable mechanism to traverse across the arena.
- In the first round the robot travelling on water surface has to collect the puddle covers floating in water and deliver them to the robot on the pathway which deposits them to their respective locations.
- In the second round, along with the puddle covers the terrestrial robot has to collect the broken pieces of the pathway (wooden planks) from drop zone and deliver them, to their specific sites for completion of the broken arena.
- Points will be awarded for collecting and depositing the objects at the end of the run. 
Collected Objects: Objects collected by the water robot from the water surface.
Picked Objects: Objects picked up by the pathway robot from the water robot.
Deposited Objects: Objects placed at the safe zones.

####Arena Description

- In this round, the length and breadth of the arena is 350 cm and 250 cm respectively.
- The arena would consist of a task zone, a start zone area, a pathway attached to an inclined plane and an area filled with water:
  - Task zone: The task zone will be 250cm long, 100 cm wide and 50cm above the surface of water.
  - Start Zone area: It would be 250cm long and 50cm wide.
  - Pathway: It would be 250 cm long and 50 cm wide.
  - Four puddle covers will be floating in water.

####Task

- The water robot has to move around in the water and collect the puddle covers floating around.
- The other robot has to traverse the arena, and with the help of a picking mechanism, collect the puddle covers collected by the water robot.
- It then has to deliver the puddle covers to their respective locations.

####First Round Rules

- Maximum time : 3 minutes.
- Number of puddle covers : 4
- Maximum number of Time-outs allowed : 2(1 min)
- Restarts allowed : 1

####Scoring Formula

- 25 points will be awarded for collecting and placing the puddle covers near the inclined plane, by the water robot from the water surface.
- 50 points will be awarded for collecting and placing the puddle covers on the pathway, by the water robot from the water surface.
- 25 points will be awarded for picking up the puddle cover by the pathway robot.
- 25 points will be awarded for delivering the puddle covers to their respective locations.
- 100 points will be deducted if the robot falls.
- 50 points will be deducted for each timeout.
- 100 points will be deducted for each restart. 
- 50 points will be deducted if the robot on the pathway drops the puddle covers.
- 25 points will be deducted if the puddle cover is not placed in the correct location.

####Formula

25*(puddle covers picked from water and placed near the i)+50*(puddle covers picked from water and placed on the pathway)+25*(puddle covers picked up by the pathway bot)+25*(puddle covers placed at the correct safe zone)-100*(robot falls)-100*(no. of restarts)-50*(no. of timeouts)-50*(dropping of puddle cover by the pathway robot) -25*(puddle covers placed in incorrect safe zone)+t’(time factor)*Time remaining(in seconds)
