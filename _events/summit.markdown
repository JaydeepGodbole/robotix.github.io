###Rules

####General rules

- Maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.
- The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply.
- Participants will have to arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.
- Teams cannot tinker with their bots during the run.
- LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms))
- The decision of the Team Robotix will be final and binding.
- The rules are subject to change.

####Event rules

- The robot needs to have a suitable mechanism to climb up the staircase.
- In the second round the robot has to collect and store the blocks, and carry them up the stairs.
- It has to deposit the blocks to the respective deposit zones distinguished by their color.
- The arena will have some 90-degree turns at each staircase landings. The bot has to manoeuvre around and climb.
- Points will be awarded for collecting and depositing the blocks at the end of the run. 
- Collected objects: Blocks on the robot.  
- Deposited Objects: Blocks at the platform.
- The third round will be One-on-One with tasks similar to previous rounds.

####Robot specification

- The robot must fit in a box of 30cm x 30cm x 30cm with a tolerance of 10% in the dimensions of robot. No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event. However the dimensions can change during the course of the run.
- Dimensions of the arena are to be considered with a maximum tolerance of 10%.

- 75 points awarded for reaching a new floor.
- Time bonus awarded.
- 50 points awarded for completing each 90 degree turn.
- 25 points deducted for bumping into the obstruction.
- 50 points will be deducted for each time out(1 allowed).
- 50 points deducted if the robot falls down the stairs.
- 100 points will be deducted for each restart(1 allowed).

####Second Round

- 75 points awarded for reaching a new floor.
- Time bonus awarded.
- 50 points awarded for completing each 90 degree turn.
- 25 points deducted for bumping into the obstruction.
- 50 points will be deducted for each time out(2 allowed).
- 50 points deducted if the robot falls down the stairs.
- 100 points will be deducted for each restart(1 allowed).
- 50 points will be awarded for picking up and storing a block.

####Task
- The robot has to climb up the staircases using a suitable mechanism.
- It has to avoid bumping into the obstruction and the surrounding wall while taking a 90 degree turn.
####Round Rules
- Maximum time: 3 minutes.
- Maximum number of Time-outs allowed :1(1 min)
- Restarts allowed : 1 NOTE: Restarts will be given only for technical fault in the bot.
####Scoring Formula
- 75 points awarded for reaching a new floor (F)
- Time factor (t)
- 50 points awarded for completing each 90 degree turn (P)
- 25 points deducted for bumping into the obstruction (B)
- 25 points will be deducted for each time out(1 allowed) (T)
- 50 points deducted if the robot falls down the stairs (Q)
- 100 points will be deducted for each restart(1 allowed) (R)

####Formula
75 * (F) + (t) * time remaining + 50 * (P) - 25 * (B) - 25 * (T) - 50 * (Q)- 100 * (R)

###ROUND 2

####Arena Description
- In this round the length x breadth x height of arena is 1.5m x 1.5m x 1.8m respectively.
- The arena would consist of three staircases each comprising of 6 stairs.
- The dimension of each stair is 50 cm x 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm.
- The dimension of each object is 3cm x 3cm x 3cm
