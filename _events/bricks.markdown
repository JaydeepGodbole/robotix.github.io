### Introduction

Imagine how convenient life would be if robots could take over simple day-to-day tasks like those of construction. A bot that would be capable of determining which blocks are useful for work and dispose the ones that aren’t.

Your job is to build a miniature version of such a bot. Sounds fun, doesn’t it?

### USP

* Weight differentiation (pressure or load sensor)

* Buttonless traversal

* Wireless data communication.

### Problem Statement

To build a robot that is capable of making a building by successfully receiving the number of blocks required sent using wireless communication and differentiating between hollow and solid bricks by successful autonomous weight detection.

### Task

* The robot will be controlled without the use of buttons, i.e, using methods such as gesture control, touch pad traversal, etc.

* The robot will be given a number of bricks required sent by us using wireless data transmission.

* This data will not be known to the controller, only the bot.

* The bot will then identify which are hollow and solid based on their weight ( hollow blocks will be interspersed amongst the solid blocks) and display them using LEDs.

* If the LED lights up as red, the controller will realize that the block is of no use to him and then the hollow bricks have to be picked up and placed in the dustbin.

* If the LED lights up as green, the user will know that the block is required in the tower and then deposit it in the required construction site.

* For solid blocks; the blocks will be of different shapes and have to be placed on their corresponding platforms present at different heights.

* Traversal has to be done without hitting the obstacles.

#### Arena Components

All the heights are with respect to the corresponding floor

**Robot specification:**

* The robot must fit in a box of 30cm x 30cm x 30cm with a tolerance of 10% in the dimensions of robot. No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event. However the dimensions can change during the course of the run.

* Dimensions of the arena are to be considered with a maximum tolerance of 10%.

#### Event Rules

* The robot can have any suitable buttonless mechanism for traversal.

* In the second round the robot has to interpret data transmitted wirelessly.

* It has to deposit the blocks to the respective deposit zones distinguished by their based upon whether they are waste or useful.

* The arena will have some obstructions which the robot will have to avoid.

* Points will be awarded for correct identification and deposition of the blocks at the end of the run.
Correct identification: Whether block is useful or waste (according to weight).
Deposited Objects: Blocks on the correct deposit zone.

#### Round 1

**Task:**

* This round will consist solely of hollow or solid blocks.

* The bot will have to identify correctly whether the block is hollow or solid.

* For solid blocks, the block will have to be deposited in the correct zone according to shape.

* For hollow blocks, they will be deposited in the Waste Box at the centre of the arena.

* This has to be done while avoiding the obstacles.

**Round rules:**

* Maximum time: 3 minutes.

* Maximum number of Time-outs allowed :1(1 min)

* Restarts allowed : 1
NOTE: Restarts will be given only for technical fault in the bot.

**Scoring Formula:**

* Correct identification via LED. ( + 30) (P)

* Picking up blocks (+40) (Q)

* Dropping off at the correct venue.(+50) (R)

* Time factor(+2)(T)

* Incorrect identification. ( -20) (A)

* Dropping blocks.(-30)(B)

* Placing in incorrect zone.(-30)(C)

* Touching obstacles.(-15)(D)

* 100 points will be deducted for each restart(1 allowed) (S)

**Formula:**

`30*P +40*Q+50*R+ 2*(Time remaining)- 20*A -30*B-30*C -15*D-100*S`

#### Round 2

**Task:**

* This round will also have a block of weight between those of the hollow and solid blocks.

* The bot will be given data about how many solid and semi solid blocks will be needed.

* The bot will have to correctly display which block is needed and which isn’t by lighting up the corresponding LED.

* The controller will then have to pick up the blocks and place them in the corresponding zones.

* In this round some solid and semi filled blocks may also be have to placed in the dustbin once the required number has been placed in the construction site.

**Round rules:**

* Maximum time: 5 minutes.

* Maximum number of Time-outs allowed :2(1 min)

* Restarts allowed : 1
NOTE: Restarts will be given only for technical fault in the bot.

**Scoring Formula:**

* Correct identification via LED. ( + 30) (P)

* Picking up blocks (+40) (Q)

* Dropping off at the correct venue.(+50) (R)

* Time factor(+2)(T)

* Incorrect identification. ( -20) (A)

* Dropping blocks.(-30)(B)

* Placing in incorrect zone.(-30)(C)

* Touching obstacles.(-15)(D)

* 100 points will be deducted for each restart(1 allowed) (S)

**Formula: **

`30*P +40*Q+50*R+ 2*(Time remaining)- 20*A -30*B-30*C -15*D-100*S`

**RULES:**

**General Rules:**

* Maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.

* The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply.

* Participants will have to arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.

* Teams cannot tinker with their bots during the run.

* LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed.[ (](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms))

* The decision of the Team Robotix will be final and binding.

* The rules are subject to change.
