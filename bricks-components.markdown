**Hey KGPians,**

Thanks for showing your interest in the event B.R.I.C.K.S. 

This is the component list you will require for the event B.R.I.C.K.S. The
components list is divided into two categories: 

 * Ones which you will get in the IIT Kharagpur campus.
 * Ones which you will have to order online

This is the list of components that you will get from Choudhary
Electronics, Tech Market, IIT KGP.

| Component   | No of units   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
|             |               |
|             |               |
|             |               |
|             |               |
|             |               |

These are the components you can order online but they will take about a
week to ship it to Kharagpur.
