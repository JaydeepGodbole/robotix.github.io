###Rules

####General Rules

- A maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.
- The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply.
- Participants will have to themselves arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.
- Teams cannot tinker with their bots during the run.
- LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms))
- The decision of the Team Robotix will be final and binding.
- The rules are subject to change.

####Event Rules

- The robots need to use a suitable mechanism to traverse across the arena. .
- In the first round the robot travelling on water surface has to pick up the victims floating in water and deliver them to the robot on the bridge which deposits them in the safe zone.
- In the second round, along with saving the victims the robot travelling in water has to pick up the broken pieces of the bridge (wooden planks) from water surface and deliver them, to the robot moving on the bridge, for completion of the broken bridge.
- Points will be awarded for collecting and depositing the objects at the end of the run. 
- Collected Objects: Objects collected by the water robot from the water surface.
- Picked Objects: Objects picked up by the bridge robot from the water robot.
- Deposited Objects: Objects placed at the safe zones.
           
####Robot specification

- The water robot must fit in a box of 40cm x 40cm x 30cm and the terrestrial robot must fit in a box of 40cm x 30cm x 30cm, both with a tolerance of 10% in the dimensions of robot. No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event. However the dimensions can change during the course of the run
- Dimensions of the arena are to be considered with a maximum tolerance of 10%.
