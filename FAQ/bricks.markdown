Q: How do I register for the event? Is there any abstract submission for
the event? 

```
Registration for the events has to be done from www.ktj.in. No abstract
submission is required.
```
Q: How many members can be there in a team and how many team members can
control the motion of the bot during the run?

```
There can be a maximum of 4 members in a team and only 2 team members can
control the robot during the run. Also you cannot change the teammates who
are controlling the bot during the run. You will have to take a timeout for
that purpose. You can also alot a team member with the task of holding the
wires of the robot so that they do not interfere with the arena or the bot.
```
Q: What kind  of micro controller can be used to control the locomotion and
gripping of the robot? 

```
Any 16 bit or less micro controller can be used for the locomotion and
gripping mechanisms. To see whether you micro controller is 16 Bit or less
refer to its datasheet.

Q: What will be the dimensions and materials of the blocks? 

```
Size of blocks will be 6*6*6. The weight of hollow block will be less
50 grams, solid blocks will be 70 grams and no block will weigh more than
200 grams.
```

Q: Can the bot be connected to the Laptop during the run? 

```
Yes, the bot can be connected to the laptop during the run, but it can only
be done if you are using the laptop camera for gesture communication. All
on board processing as well as locomotions and movements must be on the
8/16 bit micro controller. You cannot use the laptop only as a power source
either and you must burn the code on the bot and also have a power source
like an on board battery or an adapter source.
