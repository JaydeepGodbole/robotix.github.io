Q: What is the maximum dimension of the bot during the run? Is there any fixed limitation or can we extend the length to any extent as we wish? 

```
Robot should fit into a cubical box of side 30 cm . No part/mechanism of/on
the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the
event. However the dimensions can change during the course of the run.
