**ROPE TRAVERSAL MECHANISM:**

There are various mechanisms which can be inculcated to make robots traverse on ropes.This is a short insight to such mechanisms.This is not a step by step guide for you to learn the mechanism but surely it is enough to build a solid foundation for you to develop your  own rope traversal robot.

**OBJECTIVE:**  
To understand different types of rope traversal mechanisms.

**LOCOMOTION ON ROPE:**  
The various steps involved in successfully traversing the rope are as follows-

* Clasping the rope.
* Traversing on rope.
* Controlling movement on rope.

  
**FIRST MECHANISM:**

* This mechanism includes the use of two wheels or rather pulleys  grasping in middle the rope,the rotatory motion of the former makes the robot travel in the forward and backward direction.(see the figure below)
* This mechanism can be effectively used by placing two wheels adjacent to one another with their axis of rotation being perpendicular to the rope.
* The motion of these wheels can be facilitated using two motors.
* The distance between the pulleys should be less than the diameter of the rope.
* The precautious  thing here is the weight of the robot which shouldn't be too high else the robot will slip down.

In this figure we have used two wheels placed adjacent to each other .  
We have used a cycle brake to grip the rope for a controlled motion.  
Another alternative way can be to use pipes and let the rope pass through it and we grip or clasp the pipe to stop the relative motion of the rope.  
The two wheels are powered by two separate motors as you can see from the figure.  
The inner walls of the wheels have been covered with rubber to increase fiction for a controlled movement.

**MECHANISM TWO:**  
(Like Rack and Pinion)

The mechanism consists of a crank, connecting rod and end bar.

A DC motor is connected with the crank to rotate it. When the crank is rotated , the angular motion of the crank is converted to the linear motion of the end bar and the input torque from the DC motor is transformed into linear force on the robot. In order for the linear motion to succeed, the end bar is attached to the slider as shown in figure, so that the slider will guide the end to move in linear direction. Then with the help of the 2 clampers, the linear motion will be used to travel the rope.  
The clampers are used as a stoppage to prevent the robot from slipping.

Here is a flow chart that can help you control the robot:

**WATER TRAVERSING MECHANISMS :**

**Robot Boat :**  
**Link:** <http://www.societyofrobots.com/robot_thai_boat.shtml>

**Weight:** If the weight is too much, the boat will sink dangerously low - or at least add a lot of drag to its movement.  
Sinking depth = boat weight / (density of water * boat length * boat width)

**Hull:**  
There are several types of hull shapes, so here is a quick description of each:

**Actuators:**  
Higher speed DC motors
